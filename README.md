# Pennsylvania Road Lighting and Safety

This repository demonstrates the use of R to analyze the relationship between roadway lighting (i.e. streetlights) and crashes on major roads in Pennsylvania.

This project combines:

* Road segment and traffic count data from [FHWA HPMS](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/shapefiles.cfm)
* Crash Data from [PennDOT's Public Crash Databases](https://crashinfo.penndot.gov/PCIT/welcome.html)

to attempt to identify if roadway lighting is associated with greater or fewer crashes.
